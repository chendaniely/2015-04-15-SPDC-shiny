# How to download and get the files
There are 2 ways you can get the files

1. If you know your way around github you can clone this repository.
2. You can click the "Download Zip" button to the right and unzip all the files on to your computer.

The Material used for the lesson are in the `lessons` folder.  They are numbered so you can go through them the exact same way I did during the talk.

# How to view/render the files

To render or run everything: The simplest way is to open the `.Rmd` files and click `knit html` and have the presentation and rmarkdown documents render for you.
If you want to run the shiny app.  You have to open the `ui.R` and `server.R` files in rstudio, then you will have a `run app` button to click.

If you want, the `.html` files in the `lessons` folder can be viewed directly so you do not have to render them in r/rstudio to go through the slides

# Known bugs
During the 04-lesson my image was not showing up in the shiny app.  Please see the issues tap on the top right to see why.  Essentially, I needed to add the image to a `www` folder within the shiny app folder.
